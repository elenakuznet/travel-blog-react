          'I first visited Kas years ago on a two-week road trip through Turkey. It was a pretty epic adventure packed with incredible destinations, but nowhere was as memorable as Kas, a small coastal town in the Antalya Province. ',

          'Not surprising, Kas has become more touristed in recent years, but thankfully it’s retained all of its charm. In fact, I loved it more this second time around. Below is my complete travel guide to all-things Kas including the best beaches, day trips, restaurants and hotels, as well as itinerary ideas and sightseeing tips.'
