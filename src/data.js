          'I first visited Kas years ago on a two-week road trip through Turkey. It was a pretty epic adventure packed with incredible destinations, but nowhere was as memorable as Kas, a small coastal town in the Antalya Province. ',
          'Recently, I was lucky enough to return to Kas where I spent even more time exploring this stretch of Turkey’s dazzling Turquoise Coast. ',
          'Not surprising, Kas has become more touristed in recent years, but thankfully it’s retained all of its charm. In fact, I loved it more this second time around. Below is my complete travel guide to all-things Kas including the best beaches, day trips, restaurants and hotels, as well as itinerary ideas and sightseeing tips.'
