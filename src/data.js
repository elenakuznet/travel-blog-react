In this historic town, you will see what was left of this cultural center, with churches, towers, the homes of nobles, and a stunning fortress that will captivate you.',
        'Stari Bar has an astonishing array of building styles. Its multiethnic past is reflected in the harmonious coexistence of churches, mosques, and fortifications. Earthquakes, wars, and restorations have shaped the town throughout time, however, it’s core characteristics and allure remain, which you can witness on every corner.',
        'For visitors, the most important part of the old town is the Stari Bar Fortress. You won’t miss it from the outside, with its large imposing stone walls and sturdy round turrets at the corners',

          'Kas (pronounced Kash) is a small fishing village and tourist town located 170 kms west of Antalya. Built on a hill running down to the Mediterranean Sea, it has hot dry summers and mild winters which makes it ideal for growing fruit and vegetables. Although it is still a source of agriculture, tourism now provides its main income.',
          'The island’s size makes it easy to explore in a few hours – boat taxis leave from the harbour for Aya Georgio beach and the spectacular Blue Cave – although I rarely do much but potter between the neoclassical mansions that line the harbour, pristine in shades of duck-egg blue and butter yellow. Lunch is inevitably a long, slow affair, taken at one of the waterfront restaurants – a little pricier than those in the backstreets, but worth it for the view back across to the rooftops of Kaş, clustered on the other side of the water.',
          'Not surprising, Kas has become more touristed in recent years, but thankfully it’s retained all of its charm. In fact, I loved it more this second time around. Below is my complete travel guide to all-things Kas including the best beaches, day trips, restaurants and hotels, as well as itinerary ideas and sightseeing tips.'

        'Cameron Highlands was named after William Cameron, a British Government surveyor who discovered it in 1885 on a mapping expedition but failed to mark his discovery. It was not until 1925 that Sir George Maxwell recorded Camerons discovery and developed it as a hill station attracting British colonials and expatriates, including British planters who realised the potential of its fertile mountain slopes for growing tea.',
        'Set 1,500 metres above sea level in a forested mountainscape, Cameron Highlands Resort is built as a long extension from an existing 1930s cottage with architecture dating from the 1970s. Promising splendour, romance and nostalgia, the interiors hark back to its grand colonial heritage with tall French doors, timber-beamed ceilings and plantation shutters combined with the colours and textures of Jim Thompson’s famed Asian silks. This is mirrored in the friendly service, where traditional English charm merges seamlessly with discreet Asian hospitality.',
        'Endearingly known as the little piece of England in Asia, the cool climate on the picturesque plateau and its hilly greenery are tailor-made for rounds of golf, pink-cheeked rambles along jungle trails, tea plantations, farms or gardens, afternoon tea with scones and spa treatments that celebrate the restorative powers of tea. Elegant interiors, lush surroundings and five-star care set the tone for the perfect highland getaway filled with trails, tales and traditions.',
